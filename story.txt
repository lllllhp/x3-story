It’s a chilling story. A man known as the Traveller is visiting a foreign penal colony where he is shown a special machine used to execute prisoners. The machine inscribes the prisoner’s crime onto their body until they die (kind of sounds familiar if you’ve read the fifth Harry Potter book). It takes twelve hours of torture before the prisoner dies. I told you it was chilling!
Hopefully, this doesn't exist in reality!

The Traveller is frightened by this form of torture, and returns home to tell his motherland. He is determined to help the colony since he make friends in the colony.
