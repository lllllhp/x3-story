It’s a chilling story. A man known as the Traveller is visiting a foreign penal colony where he is shown a special machine used to execute prisoners. The machine inscribes the prisoner’s crime onto their body until they die (kind of sounds familiar if you’ve read the fifth Harry Potter book). It takes twelve hours of torture before the prisoner dies. I told you it was chilling!


The Traveller is frightened by this form of torture, and returns home to tell his motherland. He is determined to help the colony since he make friends in the colony.

The Traveller moves across his great counry, spreading the horrors of torture that he experienced. He was determined to make a change and find the origins of the horrendous machine. Spreading the word, finally people come to realize the terrible nature of this form of torture.

From then on, nobody dares to mess with this penal colony.
